**《身体由我：关于了不起的女性身体的一切》** #健康

了解女性生殖系统。
原来子宫比我想象中的小多了。

**《The PARA Method: Simplify, Organize, and Master Your Digital Life》** #技术
A management system for digital life.

> Weather you want to save excerpts from a book you’re reading, a voice memo about an interesting new idea,inspiring quotes from a podcast interview, web bookmarks with useful online resources, notes from important meetings or phone calls at work, photos that remind you of cherished memories, or your own personal journal entries, this system will equip you with a set of tools for preserving any information far into the future. And not only preserving it, but skillfully using it to achieve anything you set your mind to.

In my opinion, I want to build an app to record important things from the Internet, life, or reading books. Using the PARA method to organize the information seems like a good idea.

> PARA is based on a simple observation: there are only four categories that encompass all the information in your life. Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.
